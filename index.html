        The first time I saw primary school children grouping numbers, I was an undergraduate volunteering as a tutor. All I
        wanted to do was erase and start over by crossing out and carrying over numbers. Then I become a teacher. Wow! If only I
        had learned mental maths in this way, I might have stuck with mathematics a lot longer. Even as a teacher, being trained
        in Singapore maths transformed my ability to execute problems in my head.

        As a teacher, instruction in mental maths was always more difficult when well-meaning parents taught their children the
        old way. In this post, you will learn the most common mistakes in supporting learning for your child. You will feel more
        confident in fostering their mental maths skills.

      <h1>Top Mental Maths Mistakes</h1>
      <h2>1. Teaching the Algorithm too Soon</h2>
      <p>The problem:</p>
      <p>
        Do you remember learning how to cross out numbers and carry them over? Or maybe all the steps to long division? In
        teacher speak, that is called an algorithm. To be honest, this was about the only tool in my arsenal prior to becoming
        a teacher. Then I learned how mental maths is done right.

        As a teacher, I always cringed when a child came in proudly announcing that their parents taught them a trick to avoid
        adding or subtracting in their head. Usually all the other children would ask to learn the trick during free time.
        Pretty soon, this resulted in the whole class avoiding mental maths. It is not that the algorithm is useless; once children have a solid number sense, we teach the algorithm. If we teach it too soon, however, then the
        children rely on writing down formulas instead of developing critical thinking around numbers.
      </p>
      <p>How to do it right:</p>
      <p>
        Learn 10 pairs really well. These are numbers that add up to 10 (like 7 and 3). The more your children are familiar with
        these, the better their mental maths will become.
        Understand parts of a whole. We need to learn how to think about numbers and their parts before using the algorithm. For
        example, think about the number 26 as (20 + 6) in order to more easily add on other numbers. This will give you way more
        speed than carrying and crossing out. This skill will also last many more years, even as the numbers become more
        complex.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Being Afraid of Counting Tools for Mental Maths</h2>
      <p>
        Are your children relying on counting their fingers for mental maths? No need to stress it! The first step to conquering
        thinking about numbers is using manipulatives (counting tools, which could be anything from tokens to fingers). Children
        need to be able to see numbers in action as many times as possible in order to think about them. Fingers are actually
        perfect because the total number of 10 helps children visualize 10-pairs well.
      </p>
      <h2>3. Focusing on Memorization</h2>
      <p>
        My biggest surprise about teaching maths in the UK was the focus on memorizing the multiplication table. Personally, I
        cannot remember every multiplication fact I memorized at age seven. I do know how to find those answers using mental
        maths strategies. Of course, if you are in the UK, you will need to make sure your children memorize the table for their
        standardized tests. When it comes to mental maths, however, help your children think about number parts and 10-pairs
        rather than memorizing.
